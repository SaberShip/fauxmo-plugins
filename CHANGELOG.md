# [Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com)

## 20190702

- Major changes to HomeAssistantPlugin thanks to
  [jld3103](https://github.com/jld3103):
  - Renamed plugin file
  - Now uses `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN` for authentication
  - No longer has any non-stdlib dependencies, and as such, I will likely move
    this into the main Fauxmo repo and have it installed automatically
    alongside the other default plugins.
- Format with [black](https://github.com/python/black)

## 20180508

- Decided to keep a changelog
- Added MQTT Plugin thanks to [Perforex](https://github.com/Perforex)
